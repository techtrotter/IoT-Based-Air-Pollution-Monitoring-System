# IoT-Based Air Pollution Monitoring System

This repository contains a real-time air quality monitoring system built using IoT technologies. It measures the concentration of harmful gases like COâ‚‚ and CO using an MQ-135 sensor, processes the data using an ESP8266 microcontroller, and uploads the values to ThingSpeak for live visualization.

Developed as a B.Tech final year project, this solution provides an affordable and scalable way to measure air pollution across indoor and outdoor environments.

## ðŸ›  Software & Libraries

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- ESP8266WiFi Library
- ThingSpeak Library
- Serial Monitor (for debugging and calibration)

## âš™ How It Works

1. **Sensor Reading**: MQ-135 outputs analog values representing air quality.
2. **Wi-Fi Connection**: ESP8266 connects to a local Wi-Fi network.
3. **Data Upload**: The analog reading is sent to ThingSpeak every 20 seconds.
4. **Visualization**: ThingSpeak plots the data in real-time.
5. **Threshold Alerts**: Optionally, thresholds can be configured to trigger alerts.

##  Sample Code (air_pollution.ino)

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <ThingSpeak.h>

const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";
const char* writeAPIKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
unsigned long channelNumber = 123456;

WiFiClient client;
int gasSensorPin = A0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting...");
  }
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop() {
  int airQuality = analogRead(gasSensorPin);
  Serial.println(airQuality);
  ThingSpeak.writeField(channelNumber, 1, airQuality, writeAPIKey);
  delay(20000);
}
